  "about": {
    "origin": "It was a regular day when we, Mohit and Surya Purohit, were heading to Ghaziabad Railway Station from our society. We booked a cab and noticed another person also taking a cab from our area. When we reached the station, we saw the same person at the parking lot. That's when it hit us - we both paid Rs.300 separately for the same route. If we had known we were going to the same place, we could have shared the ride and paid just Rs.300 total, saving Rs.300 together!",
    "spark": "This simple observation sparked an idea: What if there was an app that could connect people traveling to the same destination? And that's how Snapgo was born - from a personal experience that we knew thousands of others faced every day.",
    "mission": "To make travel affordable and accessible for everyone by connecting people who share similar routes, reducing costs and environmental impact.",
    "vision": "To become India's most trusted ride-sharing platform, creating a community where safety, affordability, and sustainability go hand in hand.",
    "values": "Safety first, user-centric design, transparency, sustainability, and creating value for our community at every step."
