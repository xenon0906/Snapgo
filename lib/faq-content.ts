  // General Questions
  {
    question: 'What is Snapgo?',
    answer:
      'Snapgo is India\'s trusted ride-sharing platform that connects travelers heading to the same destination. Instead of traveling alone in a cab, you can find verified co-riders going your way and split the fare, saving up to 75% on your daily commute while reducing your carbon footprint.',
    category: 'General',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does Snapgo matching work?',
    answer:
      'Snapgo uses smart location-based matching. For real-time rides, we search for riders within a 750m radius of your location heading to a similar destination. For scheduled rides, the search radius extends to 2km. Once matched, you can chat with your co-rider and coordinate the pickup.',
    category: 'General',
  },
  {

  {
    question: 'What is the difference between Real-Time and Scheduled rides?',
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: 'Does Snapgo book cabs for me?',
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use Snapgo for intercity travel?',
