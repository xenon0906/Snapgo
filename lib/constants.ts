export const ABOUT_STORY = {
  origin: "It was a regular day when we, Mohit and Surya Purohit, were heading to Ghaziabad Railway Station from our society. We booked a cab and noticed another person also taking a cab from our area. When we reached the station, we saw the same person at the parking lot. That's when it hit us - we both paid ₹300 separately for the same route. If we had known we were going to the same place, we could have shared the ride and paid just ₹300 total, saving ₹300 together!",
  spark: "This simple observation sparked an idea: What if there was an app that could connect people traveling to the same destination? And that's how Snapgo was born - from a personal experience that we knew thousands of others faced every day.",
  mission: 'To make travel affordable and accessible for everyone by connecting people who share similar routes, reducing costs and environmental impact.',
  vision: "To become India's most trusted ride-sharing platform, creating a community where safety, affordability, and sustainability go hand in hand.",
  values: 'Safety first, user-centric design, transparency, sustainability, and creating value for our community at every step.',
